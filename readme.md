# HeroXP

In this project I parse replay files from the game Heroes of the Storm into a SQLite database to use for my own analyses. The initial idea was to analyse gameplay changes to the experience gain system in the game.

## Getting started

Have a look at the analyses in the analysis folder.

## Data

I will only include processed data into github and not the database.
