# HeroXP

In this project I parse replay files from the game Heroes of the Storm into a SQLite database to use for my own analyses. The initial idea was to analyse gameplay changes to the experience gain system in the game.

## Getting started

Have a look at the analyses in the analysis folder. 

If you want to use the parser it can be found in the data folder. To use it you need the heroprotocol repository https://github.com/Blizzard/heroprotocol.

## Data

I will only include processed data into github and not the database.
